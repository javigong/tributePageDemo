        Juan de Mariana, Also known as Father Mariana (25 September 1536 – 17 February 1624), was a 
        Spanish Jesuit priest, Scholastic, historian, and member of the Monarchomachs.

      <h3 id="headline">Foundations of the Austrian School of economics</h3>
      <p>
            The prehistory the Austrian School of economics can be found in the works of the Spanish
            scholastics written in what is known as the "Spanish Golden Century," which ran from the 
            mid- sixteenth century through the seventeenth century.
      </p>
      <p>
            Who were these Spanish intellectual forerunners of the Austrian School of economics? 
            Most of them were scholastics teaching morals and theology at the University of Salamanca, 
            in the medieval Spanish city located 150 miles northwest of Madrid, close to the border of 
            Spain with Portugal. These scholastics, mainly Dominicans and Jesuits, articulated the 
            subjectivist, dynamic, and libertarian tradition on which, two-hundred-and-fifty years later, 
            Carl Menger and his followers would place so much importance. Perhaps the most libertarian 
            of all the scholastics, particularly in his later works, was the Jesuit Father Juan de Mariana.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="headline">Natural law is morally superior to the might of the state</h3>
      <p>
        Although Father Mariana wrote many books, the first one with a libertarian content was De rege 
        et regis institutione (On the king and the royal institution), published in 1598, in which he set 
        forth his famous defense of tyrannicide. According to Mariana, any individual citizen can justly 
        assassinate a king who imposes taxes without the consent of the people, seizes the property of 
        individuals and squanders it, or prevents a meeting of a democratic parliament.3 The doctrines 
        contained in this book were apparently used to justify the assassination of the French tyrant kings 
        Henry III and Henry IV, and the book was burned in Paris by the executioner as a result of a decree 
        issued by the Parliament of Paris on July 4, 1610.4
      </p>
      <p>
        In Spain, although the authorities were not enthusiastic about it, the book was respected. In fact, 
        all Mariana did was to take an idea that natural law is morally superior to the might of the state 
        to its logical conclusion. This idea had previously been developed in detail by the great founder of 
        international law, the Dominican Francisco de Vitoria (1485 1546), who began the Spanish scholastic 
        tradition of denouncing the conquest and particularly the enslavement of the Indians by the Spaniards 
        in the New World.
      </p>

      <h3 id="headline">The king cannot demand tax without the consent of the people</h3>
      <p>
        But perhaps Mariana's most important book was the work published in 1605 with the title De monetae 
        mutatione (On the alteration of money).5 In this book, Mariana began to question whether the king was 
        the owner of the private property of his vassals or citizens and reached the clear conclusion that he 
        was not. The author then applied his distinction between a king and a tyrant and concluded that "the 
        tyrant is he who tramples everything underfoot and believes everything to belong to him; the king 
        restricts or limits his covetousness within the terms of reason and justice."
      </p>
      <p>
        From this, Mariana deduced that the king cannot demand tax without the consent of the people, since 
        taxes are simply an appropriation of part of the subjects' wealth. In order for such an appropriation 
        to be legitimate, the subjects must be in agreement. Neither may the king create state monopolies, 
        since they would simply be a disguised means of collecting taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        And neither may the king this is the most important part of the book obtain fiscal revenue by lowering 
        the metal content of the coins. Mariana realized that the reduction of the precious metal content in 
        the coins, and the increase in the number of coins in circulation, is simply a form of inflation 
        (although he does not use this word, which was unknown at the time), and that inflation inevitably 
        leads to an increase in prices because "if money falls from the legal value, all goods increase 
        unavoidably, in the same proportion as the money fell, and all the accounts break down." 
      </p>

      <h3 id="headline">Covarrubias' subjectivism and the true nature of market prices</h3>
      <p>
        The subjectivist conception initiated by Covarrubias also allowed other Spanish scholastics to get 
        a clear insight of the true nature of market prices, and of the impossibility of attaining an economic 
        equilibrium. Thus, the Jesuit Cardinal Juan de Lugo, wondering what the price of equilibrium was, as 
        early as 1643 reached the conclusion that the equilibrium depended on such a large number of specific 
        circumstances that only God was able to know it ("Pretium iustum mathematicum licet soli Deo notum"). 
        Another Jesuit, Juan de Salas, referring to the possibilities of knowing specific market information, 
        reached the very Hayekian conclusion that it was so complex that "quas exacte comprehendere et ponderare 
        Dei est non hominum" (only God, not men, can understand it exactly).
      </p>
      <h3 id="headline">Understanding the entrepreneurial processs and the coin devaluation effects </h3>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the Spanish scholastics were the first ones to introduce the dynamic concept of competition 
        (in Latin concurrentium), which is best understood as a process of rivalry among entrepreneurs. For 
        instance, Jeronimo Castillo de Bovadilla (1547 ?) wrote that "prices will go down as a result of the 
        abundance, rivalry (emulacion), and competition (concurrencia) among the sellers."
      </p>
      <p>
        This same idea is closely followed by Luis de Molina. Covarrubias also anticipated many of the 
        conclusions of Father Mariana in his empirical study on the history of the devaluation of the main 
        coin of that time, the Castilian Maravedi. This study contained a compilation of a large number of 
        statistics on the evolution of prices in the previous century and was published in Latin in his book 
        Veterum collatio numismatum (Compilation on old moneys).This book was highly praised in Italy by 
        Davanzaty and Galiani and was also quoted by Carl Menger in his Principles of Economics.
